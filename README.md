##Growing Drone Security Crisis


⭕ Drone jamming incidents have risen 35% annually, disrupting operations. 
⭕ Loss of control causes 25% of drone crashes and 30% of unauthorized access events.
⭕ Malicious drone use leads to $1.5B in damages annually. 
⭕ Traditional security fails with only 40% detection success. 
⭕ Real-time detection can improve recovery rates by 70%.

##Key features
1.AES encryption and authentication
2.FFT based signal monitoring and Continuous data backup
3.FHSS (Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum)
4. Instant Failsafe mechanism ( cryptographic data erasure followed by RTH)
