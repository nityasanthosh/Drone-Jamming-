## Growing Drone Security Crisis


⭕ Drone jamming incidents have risen 35% annually, disrupting operations. <br/>
⭕ Loss of control causes 25% of drone crashes and 30% of unauthorized access events. <br/>
⭕ Malicious drone use leads to $1.5B in damages annually. <br/>
⭕ Traditional security fails with only 40% detection success. <br/>
⭕ Real-time detection can improve recovery rates by 70%.
